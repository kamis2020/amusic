                            Pioneer Mixer DJ DJM-V10
                        </h3>
                        <p class="photo__list-text card__text">
                            Pioneer Mixer DJ DJM-V10 Born from a fresh design concept, the DJM-V10 is a new breed of mixer, built to enable the most creative DJs to craft original soundscapes. This 6-channel unit produces warm audio with energy and presence, and it’s loaded with
                            unique features. Take full control of your mix and enjoy the freedom to create something the crowd has never heard before. Connect CDJs, turntables, and other line-level audio sources to the DJM-V10’s six channels and use the
                            specially developed 4-band EQ to sculpt your sound. Fully kill the high and low frequencies and play with the two mid ranges, which use an exclusive curve, to mold your mix. There’s a brand-new filter too, controlled by the
                            dedicated knob on each channel. Bring rich texture to your tracks by selecting high or low pass, then sweeping the knob all the way from the left to the right. Unlimited creative options are available thanks to the expanded
                            send/return section on the DJM-V10. You can route audio to one of four built-in FX and up to two pieces of external equipment. Assemble a custom setup by plugging in FX units, guitar pedals, and more to further personalize
                            your performance. Route the audio back to the original channel or mix it straight into the master output. You can also choose to return it to a separate channel and tweak it further with the filter. And you can even use selected
                            smartphone apps in your performances by connecting your device via MULTI I/O. Every aspect of the DJM-V10 has been carefully designed to produce the best audio possible, and to give you the tools to shape your sound. After
                            layering elements and FX with the six channels, use the 3-band master isolator on the master output to drastically change, or fine-tune, the contours of your whole mix. And if you want to play raw, classic recordings with modern,
                            mastered ones, use the compressor – the first of its kind they’ve ever featured on a mixer – and blend together tracks you might never have dared to before. Simply turn the knob and the loudness of the audio from the selected
                            channel will be boosted, resulting in a more natural mix. Keen to spice up a track? Add harmony and depth with Beat FX including the brand-new Shimmer. If things don’t sound right behind the decks, use the new booth EQ on the
                            DJM-V10 to adjust the audio coming through the monitors. And with dual headphone outputs – each featuring their own monitor channel and level control – you can comfortably take over the decks from a DJ who’s wrapping up a set,
                            or perform back-to-back all night, without having to compromise on what you hear in your headphones. Elite sound quality Feel the warmth of the mixer’s natural sound and hear every detail in the music. They've adopted studio-
                            quality 96-kHz/64-bit mixing and dithering processing within the DSP, as well as 32-bit high-quality A/D and D/A converters. All of this, plus the low-jitter clock circuit, helps produce a full low-end that’s complemented by
                            vibrant mids and precise highs. Six channels Choose your ideal setup and plug in everything from CDJs and turntables to samplers, synths, and drum machines. To make setup easy, the analog input terminals line up with each channel
                            on the top panel, so you’ll always know where to connect your cables when you’re in the booth. 4-band EQ Sculpt your sound just the way you like with the newly developed 4-band EQ. The frequencies, curves, and boost and cut
                            amounts on each band have all been specially designed to give you total flexibility. Completely isolate the high and/or low and tweak the two mid ranges – which have their own custom curves – to fine-tune your mix. New filter
                            with dedicated knob on each channel Drastically change the sound of a track or make tiny adjustments using the newly developed filter with resonance control. Switch on high or low pass by pressing either button, then turn the
                            knob from all the way to the left (no filter applied) to the furthest position on the right (maximum filter applied). Because the high and low pass are separated, the entire range of the knob is dedicated to the option you
                            choose, giving you twice the resolution to play with compared to the filter on the DJM-900NXS2. This means you can make much more nuanced adjustments to the effect. Send/return section Send audio to one of four built-in FX
                            and up to two pieces of external equipment to create unique sounds and even live remixes. You can connect a variety of units to the TRS jack send/return terminals such as guitar pedals, FX units, and more. The built-in send/return
                            FX are Short Delay, Long Delay, Dub Echo, and Reverb. With parameter knobs at your fingertips, you can further tweak the FX as follows: • Size/Feedback: changes the room size when using a reverb, and the feedback amount when
                            using delays and echoes. • Time: adjusts the decay time of the reverb and the delay time for delays and echoes. • Tone: changes the hue of the effected sound, making it deep and heavy or light and crisp. • Master Mix Level:
                            acts as the overall volume of the effected sound when Master Mix is turned on. Whether you’re using external equipment or the built-in FX, you decide where you want to return the audio to. Route it to an empty channel and make
                            further changes to the effected sound using the EQ and filter. You can even drop it straight into your mix by turning on the Master Mix to route it to the master output. 3-band master isolator Effortlessly control the tone
                            of your entire mix using the 3-band master isolator, which features new boost/cut curves and adjustments to the crossover frequencies and other parameters. Grab the large dials and hype up the crowd by drastically changing
                            the sound. Compressor knob on each channel If you want to play old or unmastered tracks but you’re worried they’ll be overwhelmed by the loudness of music made with modern production techniques, the DJM-V10 has the solution.
                            Turn the compressor knob on the relevant channel and the mixer will “beef up” the audio in real time. The quieter the track, the more pressure is added, boosting the sound of “weaker” tracks and having a minimal effect on mastered
                            music. Dual headphones output and booth EQ Plug in your headphones at the same time as another DJ and enjoy independent monitoring. Each headphones output has its own Cue/Master Mix control and level adjustment knob so you
                            can choose what you want to hear as you prepare to take over the decks, or during back-to-back sets. And, with booth EQ, you can tweak the sound from the monitor speakers to prevent ear fatigue during long sets. 9. Support

                        </h3>
                        <p class="photo__list-text card__text">
                            The Technics SL-1210 MK7 turntable is a new development of a model that has become very popular with music lovers and DJs. In the Technics SL-1210 MK7 model, of course, the main design principle was retained - direct drive from a high starting torque
                            motor. The direct drive ensures stable and accurate maintenance of the plate rotation speed, as well as the possibility of its smooth adjustment and manual braking (the last two circumstances make the player so desirable for
                            professionals). In the Technics SL-1210 MK7 model, the engine has been improved, which further improved its parameters and increased reliability and stability. The Technics SL-1210 MK7 features a statically balanced S-shaped
                            arm, also a classic for the company's turntables. Thanks to high precision workmanship and thoughtful design, the tonearm provides excellent tracking and high-quality sound even on records with an imperfect surface. The Technics
                            SL-1210 MK7 features a massive, non-resonating die-cast aluminum chassis with an ABS plate at the bottom, which is mounted on combined dampened mounts - they have a rubber shell and an internal spring. At the same time, the
                            supports are height adjustable, which allows you to set the Technics SL-1210 MK7 exactly horizontally even on uneven surfaces. The platter in the turntable is also aluminum and is covered with rubber on top, which dampens it,
                            and also serves as a mat for the record. The color of the illumination of the strobe and controls in the player can be changed using a microswitch. The Technics SL-1210 MK7 features a digital pitch control circuit with a range
                            of ±8% or 16% for improved pitch control. The Technics SL-1210 MK7 is equipped with an electronic speed switch of 33, 45 or 78 rpm. There is also a handy Target Light, which was first used in the SL-1210 MK2. Using a bright
                            white LED for lighting makes the player easy to use even in dark rooms.
